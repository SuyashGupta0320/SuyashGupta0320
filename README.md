👋 **Hi, I’m Suyash**

I’m a high school student interested in computer science, backend development, and systems-level thinking. I enjoy building projects that solve real problems and using them as a way to understand how software works beyond just writing code.

💻 **What I Work On**

* Backend and full-stack projects

* APIs, authentication, and data handling

* Exploring how security, performance, and scalability affect real applications

🧠 **Currently Learning**

* Backend architecture and API design

* Databases and data modeling

* Security concepts and defensive programming

* How to structure larger projects cleanly and maintainably

🛠 **Technical Skills**

* **Languages:** Python, JavaScript

* **Frameworks:** Flask

* **Databases:** MongoDB

* Tools: Git, GitHub, Docker, VS Code

📂 **Projects**

Most of my repositories reflect my learning process and growth as a developer. They include:

* Practical tools and services I’ve built for real use

* Experiments to better understand systems, security, and architecture

* Iterative projects where I improve the design over time
